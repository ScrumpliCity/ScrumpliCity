Learners build a paper city from prefabricated crafting-templates, while the website guides them step by step through the various phases. Work is carried out in teams that are organised together in a room. A room therefore brings together several project teams—for example, a school class divided into four teams."

    "prerequisites": {
      "title": "Prerequisites",
      "description": "Each team needs a laptop for the game. The learners use this to join the room and manage their user stories. As ScrumpliCity does not include a product backlog, teams will need to manage this externally—for example in an online tool or in the traditional way using sticky notes. The teams don't need glue to build the paper city, but they do need scissors and optional coloured pencils to customise the result. You can find more information about the crafting-templates in the instructions in the downloadable .zip folder."

      "title": "Scrum content",

These are estimated with story points by the learners, assigned to a team member and expanded with acceptance criteria in the description. During the construction phase, learners can view their user stories by clicking on them in the detail box and marking them as ‘completed’. In the sprint review, the product owner checks the completed tasks—the velocity is updated automatically. The sprint completion is the transition phase between two sprints. This is where the learners decide whether user stories that have not been accepted should be discarded or carried over to the next sprint. Accepted stories are automatically archived. Finally, the learners should update the physical burn-down chart, which you can download together with the crafting-templates!"
